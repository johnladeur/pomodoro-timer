# Pomodoro Timer

**Version 1.0.0**

This is a pomodoro timer I created using Javascript.  It consists of two separate timers: one that functions as a "work" timer that counts down from 45 minutes and the "break" timer that counts down from 15 minutes.  Users can select which timer they would like to use by clicking on either the "work" or "break" radio buttons, which will temporarily disable the opposite timer.  When either timer ends, a bell sound will activate to alert the user that the session has completed.
